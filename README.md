# Optimization Methods

Peter Sharpe

-----

Toy implementations and illustrations of various optimization algorithms. Written for various purposes:

* A pedagogical exercise for myself, because I learn best by coding algorithms and then exploring resulting data structures.
* To make illustrative examples of various optimization algorithms for my teaching work.
* As a sandbox for exploring new optimization strategies.
